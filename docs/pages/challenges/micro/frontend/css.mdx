# SelectCode CSS Challenge: Figma Design Implementation

## Challenge Description üìù

Your mission is to replicate a Figma design, focusing primarily on the structural elements such as the expandable menu bar, the sticky navigation bar, and the responsive grid. We're interested in seeing how well you can interpret and translate the design to a functional webpage using HTML and CSS.

The details like typography, color, and spacing aren't the main focus here; instead, we're looking at your understanding and implementation of key UI/UX elements in both desktop and mobile views.

You have the freedom to use plain CSS, or leverage processors like SASS/LESS or even UI frameworks like Material UI or Tailwind. What we value is your approach to incremental problem-solving - so commit often, showcasing your progress and thought process.

For testing, make sure your solution looks great and works seamlessly in various environments by using tools like Chrome Dev Tools, and don't forget to check out how it appears on your smartphone too. Happy coding! üöÄ

## Challenge Requirements üìú

1. **HTML/CSS**: You're required to use HTML and CSS for this challenge. You can use pre-processors like Sass or LESS if
you'd like.

2. **Figma File**: We're providing
a [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/proto/p0DenCZpXVWBwL2ESQ4TVR/Challenge?type=design&node-id=1-2&t=uIqLbaCMsTCndc5P-1&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1)
for you to implement. Make sure to inspect the file closely to understand the design's details.

3. **Responsiveness**: The design needs to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, from mobile devices to
desktops.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: Your implementation should be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and
Safari.
