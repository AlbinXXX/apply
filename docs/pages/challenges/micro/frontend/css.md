# SelectCode CSS Challenge: Figma Design Implementation

## Challenge Description üìù

Your task is to implement a web design provided in a Figma file. Your goal is to replicate the design as accurately as
possible using HTML and CSS.

You'll need to pay close attention to the layout, typography, color, and spacing. While we don't expect pixel-perfect
precision, we do expect your implementation to be a faithful representation of the design.

## Challenge Requirements üìú

1. **HTML/CSS**: You're required to use HTML and CSS for this challenge. You can use pre-processors like Sass or LESS if
   you'd like.

2. **Figma File**: We're providing
   a [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/proto/p0DenCZpXVWBwL2ESQ4TVR/Challenge?type=design&node-id=1-2&t=uIqLbaCMsTCndc5P-1&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1)
   for you to implement. Make sure to inspect the file closely
   to understand the design's details.

3. **Responsiveness**: The design needs to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, from mobile devices to
   desktops.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: Your implementation should be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and
   Safari.
