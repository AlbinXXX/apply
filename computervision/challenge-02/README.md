# CV - Challenge 02

## Using OpenCV

Task: Write a python notebook to do the following task. Use this image to find the middle point between the two clusters
of points.

[//]: # (TODO: Include photo)

OLD:
Please describe a rough approach of how you would find the distance between the two blob cluster centers in the
following image. Assume that third parties are taking pictures of the paper sheets. We would also like you to describe
what you expect to work well and what potential issues your approach might have. If you have multiple ideas, please
discuss their tradeoffs.

## Tips:

- The Paper is the size of a A4 paper sheet
- The markers on the papers are aruco markers
- High-Level Process would be:
    - Segmentation of the paper
    - Blob detection
    - Cluster of the blobs
    - Calculation the distance between the two center of the blob clusters
