# SelectCode Application Challenges

Welcome to SelectCode, where we turn innovative ideas into startup realities and help companies achieve their IT and
sustainability goals. Our team consists of 15 talented students committed to making a difference. Are you ready to be a
part of us?

Forget about dry, whiteboard interviews or theoretical LeetCode questions. We prioritize a harmonious team fit, hands-on
experience, critical thinking, and a structured problem-solving approach.

In this repository, you' ll find a series of challenges designed to mirror the kind of work we do at SelectCode. Choose
one (or more!) to showcase your skills and apply for a position with us.


## How will my solutions be evaluated?

We take a holistic approach to evaluation. We're interested not only in the end result but also in your journey to
arrive there. We'll review your commits to understand how you approached and tackled the challenge.

Remember, **documentation** is key! Comment your code to explain your thought process, the decisions you made, and the
strategies you employed.

## Can I use ChatGPT for coding?

Absolutely! We use ChatGPT in our everyday tasks, and we encourage you to leverage its power, too. It's a great tool for
research and finding novel approaches to the challenges.

Just remember, using ChatGPT shifts the focus from pure development to debugging and improvement. If you're using
ChatGPT, consider including a link of your ChatGPT chat so we can appreciate your problem-solving journey.

Best of luck with the challenges! We can't wait to see your solutions and hopefully welcome you to our team.
