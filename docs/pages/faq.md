# Frequently Asked Questions

## How long can I do the challenges?

You have all the time you need! Our challenges are designed to be flexible and accommodating. We value quality over
speed, so take your time to craft your best solution.

But: The faster you are, the sooner we can move on in the application process.

## Can I ask other students?

Sure, collaboration and knowledge-sharing are highly encouraged. However, please make sure that the work you submit is
your own and reflects your understanding and creativity.

## How often can I submit the challenge?

You can submit a challenge as many times as you like. We value growth and improvement, so don't hesitate to refine your
solutions and re-submit them.

## Where can I submit my solution?

Submit your solution via email - with a link to your public GitHub repository and any further information required.

## How will my solutions be evaluated?

We follow a comprehensive evaluation process. Along with the final result, we're keen to understand your thought process
and problem-solving approach. Therefore, we'll look at your code commits, your documentation, and the decisions you made
during the challenge.

The evaluation criteria are listed at the end of the challenge.

## Can I use ChatGPT or other AI systems for coding?

Absolutely! In fact, we use ChatGPT regularly and appreciate its potential in problem-solving. Using ChatGPT or similar
systems shifts the focus from coding to debugging and refinement, which are critical skills in modern software
development. If you use ChatGPT, consider including the chat link to help us understand your journey.

## How important is the visual design of the frontend?

While a polished UI is nice, we're more interested in functionality and code quality. Focus on creating a clean, usable interface.

Remember, the best solutions come from dedication, creativity, and a love for problem-solving. We can't wait to see your
unique approaches to our challenges. Good luck! üçÄ
